# SEM-Drawmaton
Repository for the SEM Drawmaton, a completely mechanical machine that is capable of drawing any line-drawing. SEM is the Society for Engineering Mechanics, located at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. The SEM Drawmaton is essentially a mechanical computer, as it stores the data of the line-drawing in two physical rotors each with unique profiles. When the two rotors spin, they individually displace the linkage mechanism, which translates the rotational motion of the rotors into the movement of the pen, which draws the intended line-drawing. 

This repository includes all the files created in the development of a virtual simulation of the SEM Drawmaton, culminating in the file IOtoAnimationIMGPW.py. This file can take in an image (png, jpg,...), or a set of parametric functions to describe the line-drawing path, and outputs a Matplotlib animation showing the pen path, pen position, linkage positions, and the rotors that store the data of the pen path. It uses the OpenCV, Numpy, and Sympy libraries. In order to reduce runtimes, the file can run from stored data as a text file, or it can calculate the necessary displacement angles, store them, and then run from there.
