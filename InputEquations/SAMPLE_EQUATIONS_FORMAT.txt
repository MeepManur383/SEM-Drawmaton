Piecewise parametric file format example. There are four columns, separated by ", ".
The first entry in the ith row is the x_i(t) parametric function
The second entry in the ith row is the y_i(t) parametric function
The third entry in the ith row is the domain start value in radians (>= 0 radians)
The fourth entry in the ith row is the domain end value in radians (<= 2*pi)
The equations must start on the first row of the file
The domain start of the first row must be 0. The domain end of the last row must be 2*pi
